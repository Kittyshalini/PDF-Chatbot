# PDF-Chatbot
Chat with your PDFs using a powerful local AI! This project allows you to upload any PDF document and ask natural language questions about its content. It uses LangChain for retrieval, HuggingFace Transformers for embeddings and LLM responses, and Chroma as a vector store. Built with Python and Flask.
